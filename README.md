# SSH

This julia package implements the SSH protocol. It is intended as a study of the
protocol and to experiment with some more creative abuses of SSH as a protocol.
This is probably not the SSH server you are looking for and you should likely
not be using it in any serious projects. You may report bugs, security
vulnerabilities, etc, but there are no guarantees that they will be fixed.
You have been warned.
